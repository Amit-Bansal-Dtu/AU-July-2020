var add = (function(){
  var counter = 0;
  return function(){return counter+1;}
})()

console.log(add());
console.log(add());
console.log(add());

Output:
1
2
3

Explanation: 
Due to hoisting the variable counter becomes global, but to the outer function it still
is a local variable, thus it is initialized everytime to 0, but for the inner function 
the counter variable is the global one, which is having its value incremented each time 
add function is called, so this add function is simply working like a counter.
