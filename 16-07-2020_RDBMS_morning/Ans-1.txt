Functional Dependencies:

1) CustID--> CustName, AccountManager, AccountManageRoom, ContactName1, ContactName2
2) AccountManager-->AccountManagerRoom

Candidate keys:
(CustID)+ --> CustID, CustName, AccountManager, AccountManageRoom, ContactName1, ContactName2
so, CustID is a candidate key

(Is there any Partial Dependency?)Checking for 2NF:
There is no partial Dependency
So, the relation is already in 2NF.

(Is there any transitive Dependency?)Checking for 3NF:

There is a transitive dependency as CustID-->AccountManager, AccountManager-->AccountManagerRoom

Customer(CustID, CustName, AccountManager, Contact1, Contact2)
Manager(AccountManager, AccountManagerRoom)

Checking for BCNF:
CustID is a candidate key in Customer relation which is the only left side attribute of FD there.
AccountManager is a candidate key in Manager relation which is the only left side attribute of FD there.

So, 
Customer(CustID, CustName, AccountManager, Contact1, Contact2)
Manager(AccountManager, AccountManagerRoom)
These relations are in BCNF.
